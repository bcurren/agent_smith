- Install mongodb binary package from mongodb.org

   Use the 32-bit package for Leopard, or 64-bit for Snow Leopard
 
   start it from your login scripts with mongod --fork ~/mongo.log if you like.
   Be sure to create /data/db for it, or otherwise configure it with a data directory.

- Install nodejs from nodejs.org
  
  Compile is slow but you can do some of this other stuff while it's working

- clone the repo and init submodules
  
  git clone <project clone url>
  git submodule update --init --recursive

- On Snow Leopard only:

  sudo ln -s /usr/share /usr/local/share

  Can use mkdir instead if desired:
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man.1
  (but no guarantees about being able to read the man pages in this case)

- Give Express a place to store its libs for nodejs, and install it

  mkdir ~/.node_libraries
  cd deps/express && sudo make install-support

  (requires node compile and install to have finished)

- Install spark by cloning http://github.com/senchalabs/spark.git

- Start the event_server:

  cd event_server; spark -p 8000

- You can also use the run_servers.rb script:

  sudo gem install autotest-fsevent
  ./run_servers

# Not yet:)
# 1. Install npm: curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sudo sh
# 2. Install submodules: sh config/install_modules.sh
